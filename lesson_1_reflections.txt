viewing a diff between two versions of a file helped me find the bug that was introduced by clearly outlining the differences between the two versions of the file and the lines that have been modified...

well, obviously, having easy access to all the previous versions of your helps you in becoming an efficient programmer by providing a means of keeping track of the recent modifications you have made to ur files. This in turn helps you to easily debug your programs in the case of programming.

the pros of manually choosing when to create a commit are that you can choose the appropriate timing for creating a commit and so be satisfied with the committed versions, while the cons may be that you simply forgot to commit and you did a lot of work that needed to be committed regularly...

well, maybe because version control systems that assume that the users will be working on multiple files that need to be tracked simultaneously allow saving multiple files while systems such as Google Docs, assuming that users change only one Doc at a time may not support multiple saving...
